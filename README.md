## Executive Summary
The global population has seen rapid growth, reaching eight billion in November 2022, up from six billion in 1999. This project employed an agile methodology and Gantt charts for project planning, followed by an exploratory data analysis phase to clean and preprocess the dataset. Key insights include:

- Identification of the top five most populous countries.
- Examination of factors influencing population growth, including birth rate, death rate, fertility rate, literacy rate, and healthcare expenditure.
- Projections of future population trends for the top five countries up to the year 2100.

## Background
The United Nations forecasts that the global population will reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100. This growth presents significant challenges across various sectors, including food security, healthcare, urbanization, climate change, and biodiversity.

## Analysis
The project team adopted a structured methodology, dividing tasks among members to conduct a thorough analysis. The primary topics addressed include:

- Future population projections for the top five countries.
- Analysis of birth rates, death rates, and fertility rates.
- Examination of the percentage of GDP allocated to healthcare.
- Trends in literacy rates.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The project concludes with several recommendations to address the challenges posed by population growth:

- Increase investment in healthcare and education.
- Enhance access to family planning services.
- Tackle poverty and inequality.
- Promote international cooperation.
